In a future world, humans live in an artificial Earth that orbits the sun in a new orbit and is powered by solar energy. Because of the limited electrical energy, the power is forcibly cut off at 7 p.m. every day and the mainframe of the artificial Earth goes down autonomously in all time zones.
The device is set up in various locations on the artificial Earth and is alerted at 6:50 pm every day. The person in charge signals the downtime by clicking on a switch on the right-hand side, and two lights flash alternately. At 6am each day, when the power is restored, the person in charge clicks the left-hand switch to signal the switch on and one indicator light comes on.
